# tlstl
The Triangle C++ Standard Template Library is a custom implementation of the C++ STL that targets C++11 to C++20 (with very few C++23 specific things), focuses on readability and high performance.
It tries to be compatible with GCC, Clang and MSVC. Other compilers aren't supported.

Compiler-specific things are used with their respective compilers. https://en.cppreference.com/ has been real helpful for this project and some code snippets are taken right from there.
